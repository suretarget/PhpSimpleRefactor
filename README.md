---

Requirements
===========
You need to have PHP installed and [PHP Refactoring Browser]'s refactor.phar file. 

Installation
=======

--The package is available on [Package Control](https://sublime.wbond.net/).--

* In Sublime Text Editor,
* Open > Preferences
* Open > Browse Packages

In that folder open terminal and clone repo:

    git clone https://github.com/vukanac/PhpSimpleRefactor.git WukanacPhpSimpleRefactor
    cd WukanacPhpSimpleRefactor
    git checkout feature/config-patch-tool

Patch tool should be configurable for Windows user, as it is suggested to use `--binay` flag.

Configuration
=======
Edit the file WukanacPhpSimpleRefactor.sublime-settings (Preferences > Package Settings > WukanacPhpSimpleRefactor > Settings â€“ User) with the correct php_path and refactor_path.

Example:
	
	/** FILE: WukanacPhpSimpleRefactor.sublime-settings **/

	{
		"php_path" : "",
		"refactor_path" : "/home/dev/bin/refactor.phar",
		"patch_path" : "patch",
		"patch_opts" : "--binary",
	}

For key short-cut, in `Preferences > Key Bindings - User` add this line:
	[
		{ "keys": ["alt+shift+e"], "command": "wukanac_php_simple_refactor_extract_method" }
	]


Usage
=====
There are two functionalities:

**Extract method:** Select the lines that you'd like to extract to a new method, and use the shortcut **ctrl+alt+r** (or right click on the text and select "**WukanacPhpSimpleRefactor -> Extract method**"). The plugin will ask you for the method name to use. 

**Rename local variable:** Right click inside the scope that contains the local variable that you want to rename and select "**WukanacPhpSimpleRefactor -> Rename local variable**". The plugin will ask you for the variable old name and the new name.
